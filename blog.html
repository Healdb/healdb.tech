        <h3>Vendor and impacted product</h3>
        <p><a href="https://www.teradici.com/">Teradici</a> - PCoIP Management Console version 20.01.0 and 19.11.1<p>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>I recently discovered a simple vulnerability that had critical impact. This vulnerability was on a software package owned by a major vendor, Teradici, and so it was fortunate enough to be issued CVE-2020-10965. The impact of this vulnerability is critical, as any unauthenticated user could take complete control of the coroporations remote workstations and other system clients. Within this post I will outline the methods I used to discover this vulnerbaility.</p>
        <h3>Tools Used:
        </h3>
        <a href="https://portswigger.net/burp">Burp Suite</a>
        <a href="https://github.com/michenriksen/aquatone">Aquatone</a>
        <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome</a>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>While participating in an undiscosed bug bounty program, I discovered a subdomain with the name "mc.****.************.com". Using Aquatone, I found that ports 80 and 443 were open and displaying the following login page.</p>
        <img src="https://github.com/Healdb/healdb.tech/raw/master/blog%20image%20login.png" alt="Teradici Login page"/>
        <p> Seeing that the application was built using some kind of Javascript framework, I used the Chrome developer utilities to examine the routing files, to see if there were any interesting endpoints.</p>
        <p> To my surprise, there was a route to an endpoint called "/login/resetadminpassword" that was not programmed to redirect back to the login page.</p>
        <img src="https://github.com/Healdb/healdb.tech/raw/master/blog%20image%20routing%20js.png" alt="Teradici routing.js"/>
        <p> Visiting this link, I was even more suprised to be presented with a form to reset the Admin user's password. Using this form, any unauthenticated user was able to change the admin user's password. </p>
        <img src="https://github.com/Healdb/healdb.tech/raw/master/blog%20image%20reset%20admin.png" alt="Teradici Reset admin page"/>
        <p>This password could then be used to compromise the Teradici Management Console, and can take control of PCoIP Zero Clients and PCoIP Remote Workstation Cards managed by it.</p>
        
        <h3>Impact</h3>
        <p>From the Teradici disclosure, the impact was described as the following:</p>
        <p>"The affected Management Console releases allow unauthenticated user access to the Management Console /login/resetadminpassword URL. From here, unauthenticated users can reset the admin password on the Management Console, and can take control of PCoIP Zero Clients and PCoIP Remote Workstation Cards managed by it."</p>

        <h2 id="netflixAPI">Netflix ID Dataset</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>A few years ago I wanted to make an application that gave the user the ability to generate a random episode of any given US Netflix show. The main technical issue with this project was that Netflix does not have a public API and so matching each show or movie with the corresponding ID number found for in every episode or movie link was seemingly impossible. I however was able to find an API endpoint that allowed me to brute-force these ID #'s by simply sending thousands of requests. I have compiled this data into individual files.</p>
        <p> There are two datasets available. One older dataset that was compiled back in 2017, and is probably out of date consists of the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>movietitles.txt - A TXT file containing all Netflix movie titles and associated ID number with seperator "$"</p></li>
          <li><p>showtitles.txt - A TXT file containing all Netflix series titles and associated ID number with seperator "$"</p></li>
          <li><p>series.zip - A ZIP file containing files with name corresponding to the ID numbers in series.csv. These files contain a variety of information on the show including all the episode names and ID's.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The second dataset was compiled in September 2019 and consists of the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>movies.csv - A CSV file containing all Netflix movie titles and associated ID number</p></li>
          <li><p>series.csv - A CSV file containing all Netflix series titles and associated ID number</p></li>
          <li><p>series.zip - A ZIP file containing files with name corresponding to the ID numbers in series.csv. These files contain a variety of information on the show including all the episode names and ID's.</p></li>
          <li><p>movies.zip - A ZIP file containing files with name corresponding to the ID numbers in movies.csv. These files contain a variety of information on the movie including rating, cast, category, etc.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Methodology</h3>
        <p>In the interest in keeping too many people from accessing the Netflix API endpoint I used to gather these files, please email me at healdb2@gmail.com if you would like to know the methodology I used.</p>
